Telecommunication Analysis

This project centers on a thorough analysis of a telecommunication dataset to evaluate growth opportunities and provide a recommendation on whether TellCo is a viable candidate for acquisition or divestment. 

The dataset encompasses crucial information about customer demographics and network activities. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), we will clean and explore the data, deriving key insights and trends. 

The deliverables include an interactive web-based dashboard for visual exploration and a comprehensive written report outlining findings and strategic recommendations. Stakeholders can leverage these insights to make informed decisions regarding TellCo's potential for growth or divestment.
